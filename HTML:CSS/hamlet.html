    <p>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet’s friends, are persuading Hamlet to believe Denmark is not a horrible place. Hamlet responds to them by explaining the nature of reality in his perspective. Hamlet explains “good” and “bad” as qualities that we associate with objects, actions, or beliefs. We can, therefore, conclude that actions that one deems to be moral are regarded as immoral by others.

    <p><br>Hamlet’s view can be applied to today’s world. Researching stem cells is a rather controversial topic: some believe it is ethical, while it is deemed as unethical by others. Stem cells have the potential to be used to develop treatments for Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries, hence scientists’ enormous persistence to research them. This research, however, depends on the donation of human embryos; this is regarded as unethical by some politicians and citizens. While one may disagree with one side, it is inevitable to deny that both groups have reasonable explanations.

    <p>This soliloquy takes place when Polonius and Claudius are hiding and watching Hamlet without him being aware of their presence. Hamlet is trying to make a decision: whether living with numerous troubles or dying and getting rid of life’s difficulties is nobler. After asking this question from himself, Hamlet tries to answer it rationally; however, he has difficult coming to a conclusion. This is an instance that a difficult decision has to be made.

    <p>You might ask yourself: what major should I study in university? Who should I vote for presidency? What are my priorities in life – comfort, happiness, or a mix of both? These are just some examples of real-life difficult decisions that every person makes at some point in their life. The outcome of such decisions has a significant impact on one’s life, thus making it harder to decide what the “right” choice is. This also relates to the <a href = #Good_and_Evil id = "link2">first quotation</a>: a “right” decision does not have a fixed definition. A “right” decision may be regarded “wrong” by someone else. When making decisions, it is best to assess the situation carefully and seek the truth – characteristics of a relational decision-maker.

      Police officers often have to make fast decisions that may involve life-threatening injuries to the suspects; this privilege is given to officers to allow them to maintain safety in the city. This decision can sometimes be extremely difficult. On Monday, April 23rd, a van struck over 20 pedestrians in Toronto, leaving 10 people dead and 15 others injured, <a href = "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/23/world/toronto-collision-pedestrians/index.html" target = "_blank">CNN reports</a>. The police officer who arrested the offender demonstrated how one can make a rational choice in an extremely difficult and dangerous situation. The offender pretended that he has a gun pointed at the officer. This, however, did not frighten the officer one bit. Rather, the officer stayed calm, assessed the situation carefully, and made the right choice by not shooting him. He was then arrested. Catching him alive allows the police to find his motives and discover any national risk that may threaten Canada. In this difficult situation, most people would have shot the offender, which would not allow the police to discover any larger threat towards the nation. The officer's bravery was a great example of a rational choice made in a difficult situation.

(1.5) -Hamlet</h4>
      <p>After seeing Hamlet talking to his father’s ghost, Horatio expresses his feelings about the ghost – that it is “strange.” In this quotation, Hamlet responses to Horatio by explaining that Horatio’s thoughts are limited, thus preventing him to view every possibility.<br><br>From an early age, we have been brainwashed by the society to believe that we should act according to the gender norms. As children, we have received toys that are meant to be for boys or girls; a soldier toy for boys and a Barbie toy for girls, for instance. Over the years, these small stereotypical behaviors from our family, relatives, and society has accumulated, thus making us accept our gender roles in society. These beliefs have been wired to our brains, forcing us to make unconscious decisions regarding our career. Those of us who satisfy these social norms have a strong ego that compels us to act “normal.” Our job has been predetermined before we step into this world! This makes our thoughts and actions more limited, which in turn prevents us from pursuing our passion and reaching our full potential. We often try to justify these actions by utilizing intellectualization, a defense mechanism. Let’s use the following stereotype as an example: men should act logically, while women are expected to be extremely emotional. We often try to intellectualize our actions by saying that “scientifically” men are supposed to think more rationally, and women should express their emotions more. There is no evidence for such claims, making them merely myths. Hamlet’s perspective on world – the fact that we, as humans, are incapable of seeing everything – is homologous to our acceptance of the gender roles as a result of our limited beliefs.
